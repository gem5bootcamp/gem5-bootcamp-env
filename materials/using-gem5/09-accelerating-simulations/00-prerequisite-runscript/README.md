# Prerequisite runscript
In this module, we will complete a runscript to simulate a system with the
SimpleBoard. The basic objective is to connect all the correct components and
keep the runscript ready for all the hands-on sessions for this module. The
template for this session is available in the `template` directory. A completed
version of the same is available in the `completed` directory.

## Notes
There are three tasks to complete, marked by `TODO` in the template file.
