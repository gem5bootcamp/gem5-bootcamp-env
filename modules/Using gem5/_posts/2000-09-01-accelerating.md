## Checkpoints

- How to create a checkpoint
- How to load a checkpoint

## Fast forwarding in atomic mode

- Switching CPUs

## Fast forwarding in KVM mode

- What's required for KVM
- This will be more show and less example since students won't have access to KVM

## How to use probe points?

Not sure if this will be covered here or not. Would be good, though.
