Hands-on Session 3: Checkpoints
-------------------------------------------
This is a completed renscript file.

This is a simple script to run the a binary program using the SimpleBoard.
We will use x86 ISA for this example. This script is partly taken from
configs/example/gem5_library/arm-hello.py

* Limitations *
---------------
1. We are only simulating workloads with one CPU core.
2. The binary cannot accept any arguments.

Usage:
------

```
scons build/X86/gem5.opt -j<num_proc>
./build/X86/gem5.opt base-system.py --binary <path/to/binary>
```
